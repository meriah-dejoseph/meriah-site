    "text": "Children growing up in poverty are often portrayed in terms of risk and deficit. My research asks a different question: How do children develop in ways that help them adapt to the demands of their environments? I study how early experiences shape self-regulation and cognitive development, revealing both struggles and strength in context. By shifting the lens from what children are presumed to lack to how they adapt, my work offers a more balanced foundation for both science and policy (see DeJoseph, Ellwood-Lowe et al., 2024 Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience)."

    "text": "Understanding what experiences matter and for whom\nChildhood poverty is not experienced the same way for every child. My work shows that families facing economic hardship vary widely in what they experience and how those experiences are reported and interpreted. I’ve demonstrated that commonly used measures of adversity often mask strengths and misrepresent the lived realities of racially and socioeconomically diverse families. By uncovering biases in these tools, and by centering families’ own voices through open-ended, video-based qualitative methods, this research informs more equitable and accurate ways to capture children’s environments—and ultimately, to support them better.\n\nBlakey, E., Hendry, A., Outhwaite, L.A., Braithwaite, E.K., Reyes, G., Hernandez, I.A., Ellwood-Lowe, M.E, & DeJoseph, M.L.** (under review).

DeJoseph, PhD\n\n\nPostdoc Fellow at Stanford’s Center on Early Childhood\n\n\n           \n\n\n\nI am a NICHD F32 Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford’s Center on Early Childhood, where I study how children navigate the complexities of growing up in poverty. My research examines both the challenges children face and the adaptive strengths they develop in response, particularly focusing on self-regulation and cognitive skills. Drawing from my own experiences growing up below the poverty line, I am committed to conducting science that fully reflects the lived realities of families experiencing economic disadvantage.\nMy work integrates developmental and cognitive science with advanced methods like computational modeling, psychometrics, and causal inference. This allows me to move beyond traditional deficit-focused narratives and explore the diverse ways children adapt cognitively, behaviorally, and physiologically to their environments. Ultimately, my goal is to generate actionable insights that inform equitable policies and programs, supporting children’s existing strengths while addressing structural barriers. In doing so, my research contributes to broader efforts within the CERA network to advance strength-based approaches to understanding childhood adversity.\nPrior to coming to Stanford, I received my PhD in developmental psychology at University of Minnesota, my MA in psychology at Columbia University, and my BS in cognitive neuroscience at University of California, San Diego.\nCurrently on the 2025 academic job market.\n\n\nDownload my CV"
