DeJoseph, PhD\n\n\nPostdoc Fellow at Stanford’s Center on Early Childhood\n\n\n           \n\n\n\nI am a NICHD F32 Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford’s Center on Early Childhood, where I study how children navigate the complexities of growing up in poverty. My research examines both the challenges children face and the adaptive strengths they develop in response, particularly focusing on self-regulation and cognitive skills. Drawing from my own experiences growing up below the poverty line, I am committed to conducting science that fully reflects the lived realities of families experiencing economic disadvantage.\nMy work combines developmental psychology and cognitive science with advanced methods like computational modeling, psychometrics, and causal inference. This allows me to move beyond traditional deficit-focused narratives and explore the diverse ways children adapt cognitively, behaviorally, and physiologically to their environments. Ultimately, my goal is to generate precise and actionable insights that inform equitable policies and programs, supporting children’s existing strengths while addressing structural inequities. In doing so, my research contributes to broader efforts within the CERA network to advance strength-based approaches to studying childhood adversity.\nCurrently on the academic job market for 2025.\n\n\nDownload my CV"
